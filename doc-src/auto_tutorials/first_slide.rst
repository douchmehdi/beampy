Your first presentation
=======================

Import Beampy
-------------

To start, you need to import beampy module in your python file.

.. code-block:: python

   from beampy import *

Your first slide: Hello Beampy
------------------------------

A Beampy presentation is based on the **document** class, in which all slides and their contents will be stored. Let's create our first slide.




.. code-block:: python


    from beampy import *

    # We first create a new document for our presentation
    # Remove quiet=True to see Beampy compiler output
    doc = document(quiet=True)

    # Then we create a new slide with the title "My first new slide"
    with slide('My first slide title'):

        # All the slide contents are functions added inside the with statement.
        # Here we add a text content using the Beampy module text
        text('Hello Beampy!')

    # At the end we save our presentation to an HTML file.
    # The save command will launch the compilation of all slides of the
    # presentation.
    save('hello.html')

    # If you want to save it to pdf just change the file extension.
    # save('hello.pdf')

    # This line is just for displaying the slide in this tutorial webpage
    # Remove it in your presentation
    display_matplotlib(gcs())

Change the position of the text element
---------------------------------------

By default the text element is centred in *x* direction and automatically
positioned in *y* --which means that if you add other elements they will be
equally spaced vertically--.

Now we change the *x* and *y* with numerical values (x=0, y=0), the text is
now in the upper-left corner.



.. code-block:: python


    with slide('My first slide title'):
        text('Hello Beampy!', x=0, y=0)

    display_matplotlib(gcs())




.. image:: /auto_tutorials/images/sphx_glr_first_slide_002.png
    :align: center




When value of *x* and *y* are lower than 1.0, they are by default in percent
of slide (or group) width. So if you set *x=0.5* and *y=0.5x3/4* (as the
aspect ratio of the theme is 4/3) the text will be anchored (default anchor is
upper-left) to the center of the slide.



.. code-block:: python


    with slide('My first slide title'):
        text('Hello Beampy!', x=0.5, y=0.5*3/4.)

    display_matplotlib(gcs())




.. image:: /auto_tutorials/images/sphx_glr_first_slide_003.png
    :align: center




Now we could also set fixed position for *x* and *y*. To do so, if *x* and *y*
are greater than 1.0 and their coordinates will be in pixel.



.. code-block:: python


    with slide('My first slide title'):
        text('Hello Beampy!', x=100, y=100)

    display_matplotlib(gcs())




.. image:: /auto_tutorials/images/sphx_glr_first_slide_004.png
    :align: center




You could also give coordinates as strings and specify the units (cm, pt),
like `x='2cm'`.

**Congratulation** you have created your first Beampy slide. You can now look at:

* The gallery of :ref:`beampy_modules` to include other elements than text and get
  Beampy modules options.
* The tutorial on :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_tutorials_positioning_system.py`.
